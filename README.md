Public profile README – Compliance, AML/KYC/CDD, risk analysis, and analytical learning.

I work in Compliance and Financial Crime Prevention, with experience in AML/KYC/CDD, operational risk, claims resolution, business due diligence, and cross-functional coordination.

I use this GitHub to organise investigation frameworks, analytical notes, and my learning path in compliance and data analysis.  
My goal is to build structured, repeatable processes for customer due diligence, risk assessment, and investigative work.

### Areas of focus
- AML / CTF / Sanctions fundamentals  
- Customer Due Diligence (CDD) & Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)  
- KYB and business verification  
- Transaction monitoring logic and red flags  
- Risk-based approaches and documentation quality  
- Blockchain and digital-asset risk (learning path)  
- SQL & Python basics for investigative workflows  

### Repositories
- **AML Investigation Templates**  
- **CDD/KYB Checklists and Workflows**  
- **Risk Assessment Models (RBA)**  
- **Blockchain & FinCrime Notes**  
- **SQL/Python Learning Snippets**

This space evolves as I study, work, and refine my investigative framework.
